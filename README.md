### Hi there 👋 I'm Sertan

👨‍💼 I'm a software developer living in Istanbul. I mostly develop web services written in Ruby on Rails and Go running on AWS and just started using Azure for some projects.

⚙️ Tech stacks: **Ruby on Rails, Go, Node.js, React.js, Graphql, Docker, Postgresql, Redis and Memcached**.

🤔 Currently, I'm learning Kubernetes for orchestration and Terraform for infrastructure. My biggest desire is to work with a fully automated system.

😎 Sometimes I make music to relax on AbletonLive in my own way 🤠.
